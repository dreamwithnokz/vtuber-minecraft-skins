# VTuber Minecraft Skin

A web app that lets you see the current skin that VTubers use in Minecraft.

## Notes

- This web app uses mc-head to fetch the skins. **So if the skin sometimes shows the default skin, that's is due to the limitation of the API being used.**

- You may create an issue or a pull request if you want me to add a vtuber that isn't included in the list.

## Setup

1. Enter `yarn install` to install dependencies.

2. Enter `yarn dev` then visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.
